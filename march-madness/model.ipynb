    "March Madness is the post season, 64-team bracket for (Men's) NCAA Basketball. The winner of the tournament is deemed the national champion. It is common practice to individually fill out these brackets prior to the start of the first game. The objective of this project is to predict the outcome of a game between two selected teams, this infomation will then be used to generate an entire bracket of predictions."
